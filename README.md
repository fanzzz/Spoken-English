## Written Assignment
### Strengths

- My voice is not too small when I speaking English.At least others can hear that I'm talking about something.

### Weakness

- I have nothing to say. You know, When it comes to some topics, someone spoken very eloquently(善辩地，富于表现力的). But I have nothing to say even if in Chinese.

- When I have an idea that I want to express, I don't know how to express it. For example, When I want to express that a movie I just watched is very good. First of all, I might couldn't think of some appropriate words such as wonderful ,fantastic and excellent. Or when I remember a word that starts with "W", but it still takes a long time to think about how to spell the word and how to pronounce.

- Pronunciation and grammar. I did not learn phonetic symbols systematically, and I'm also very bad at grammar. So I will make a lot of mistakes in the sentence and wrong pronunciation in the words.

## Spoken Assignment
> Do you know some good resources of spoken English? (apps/TV series/books/...)Do you want to share with the class?

- Yes, of course. In my opinion, it is a good chioce to pratice Spoken English by watching movies. You must watch the movie with only English subtitles, even if you can't read the story development of the movie in time. You need to listen carefully to the lines in the movie and try to imitate them. You need to look over and over until you can dub the movie correctly.
